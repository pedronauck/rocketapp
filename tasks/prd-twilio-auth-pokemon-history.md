# PRD: Twilio Phone Authentication & Pokemon Query History

## Project Overview

### Objective
Build a web application that allows users to authenticate via phone number using Twilio Verify, then view and manage their Pokemon query history from the Twilio voice service. The UI will be styled according to the provided Figma Pokedex design.

### Background
- The backend already has a Twilio voice service that handles Pokemon queries via phone calls
- Database currently stores callers and conversations with Pokemon queries
- Frontend exists with basic React + Vite setup and Shadcn UI components
- Need to create a web interface for users to access their query history

### Success Metrics
- Users can authenticate with phone number + OTP
- Authenticated users can view all their Pokemon queries
- Query history displays Pokemon details, timestamps, and context
- UI matches Figma Pokedex design specifications
- Zero security vulnerabilities in auth flow

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists
- **Backend**: Twilio voice integration, SQLite database with callers/conversations tables
- **Frontend**: React + Vite setup, Shadcn UI components, theme switching
- **Database**: Stores phone numbers, names, and conversation history with Pokemon queries

### What's Missing
- Phone authentication system (Twilio Verify integration)
- Session management and JWT tokens
- API endpoints for Pokemon query retrieval
- Frontend authentication flow and protected routes
- Pokemon history display components
- Figma design implementation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Authentication (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add authentication routes to backend:
  - [x] `POST /api/auth/send-verification` - Send SMS with 6-digit code
  - [x] `POST /api/auth/verify` - Verify code and create session
  - [x] `GET /api/auth/session` - Get current user session
  - [x] `POST /api/auth/logout` - End session
- [x] Create sessions table in database
- [x] Implement JWT token generation and validation

- Test on multiple screen sizes

### Phase 6: Testing & Security (LOW PRIORITY)

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Add unit tests for auth logic
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Security audit of auth implementation
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention

**Technical Requirements:**

- Test phone number edge cases
- Verify JWT security
- Test session expiry handling

## Technical Guidelines

### Architecture Decisions
- **Authentication**: Twilio Verify for OTP, JWT for sessions
- **State Management**: React Query + Context API
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with protected routes
- **Database**: Extend existing SQLite schema
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling

### Security Considerations
- Never store raw phone numbers in frontend
- Use HTTP-only cookies for JWT tokens
- Implement CSRF protection
- Rate limit verification attempts
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Log security events

### Performance Targets
- OTP delivery < 5 seconds
- Page load < 2 seconds
- API response < 500ms
- Smooth scrolling with 100+ Pokemon

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:

- ✅ Sessions persist across page refreshes
- ✅ Logout properly clears session

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- ✅ Authenticated users can fetch their queries

- ✅ Pagination works correctly
- ✅ Unauthorized access is blocked

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- ✅ Phone input validates international numbers
- ✅ OTP input auto-submits on 6 digits
- ✅ Auth state persists on refresh

### Risks
- **Rate Limits**: Twilio SMS limits may affect testing
- **Phone Validation**: International number complexity
- **Design Complexity**: Figma design may require custom components
- **Data Migration**: Existing conversation format may need parsing

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 1 day
- Phase 2: 0.5 days
- Phase 3: 1 day
- Phase 4: 1 day
- Phase 5: 0.5 days
- Phase 6: 0.5 days

**Total: 4.5 days**

## Notes
- Prioritize getting basic auth working before polish
- Consider using Twilio's built-in rate limiting
- May need to enrich Pokemon data from external API
